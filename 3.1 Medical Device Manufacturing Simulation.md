# Medical Device Manufacturing Simulation - Arena Model
#### This repository contains an Arena Simulation Model for optimizing a medical device manufacturing system. 
#### The goal is to analyze order processing, machine utilization, queueing behavior, inventory management, and financial performance to improve efficiency and reduce costs.

## Problem Overview
#### A medical device manufacturer produces two types of test kits (Type A & Type B) using a make-to-order (pull system). 
#### The simulation captures:

#### ✔️ Order Arrivals (exponentially distributed with peak and normal hours)
#### ✔️ Machine Processing & Setup (separate machines for Type A & B, operator setup time)
#### ✔️ Inspection & Rework Process (70% pass, 20% rework, 10% scrap)
#### ✔️ Inventory Management (Kanban reorder system with EOQ)
#### ✔️ Resource Allocation (operators, foreman replacements, machine utilization)
#### ✔️ Financial Analysis (cost, revenue, and profit estimation)

## Simulation Objectives
#### The model estimates key performance metrics, including:

#### ✅ Order Cycle Time (Type A & B orders)
#### ✅ Queue Lengths at machines and rework stations
#### ✅ Reorder Kanban Efficiency
#### ✅ Machine & Operator Utilization
#### ✅ Rework & Scrap Rates
#### ✅ Inventory Levels for Type A & B kits
#### ✅ Daily Profit Calculation

## Results & Insights
#### 📌 Identifies production bottlenecks & inefficiencies
#### 📌 Optimizes machine utilization & staffing schedules
#### 📌 Evaluates inventory replenishment strategies
#### 📌 Improves profitability through process optimization
