# Fast-Food Restaurant Queuing System Simulation Modelling and Analysis
#### This repository contains an Arena Simulation Model for optimizing a fast-food restaurant’s operations. The goal is to analyze customer flow, service times, queue lengths, and resource utilization to improve efficiency and reduce wait times.

### 🚀 Problem Overview
#### The restaurant serves three types of customers (walk-in, drive-through, and a soccer team) with varying arrival patterns. The simulation captures:

#### ✔️ Customer Arrivals (exponential distribution for walk-in & drive-through, fixed for the soccer team)
#### ✔️ Order Process & Queueing (cashier priority for drive-through customers)
#### ✔️ Meal Preparation (handled by cashiers & cooks with specific rules)
#### ✔️ Resource Utilization (full-time & part-time cashiers, cooks, and peak-hour staffing)
#### ✔️ Customer Behavior (walk-in dining, drive-through dropouts, and return rates)
#### ✔️ Financial Performance (profitability analysis & lost sales impact)

## 🔍 Simulation Objectives
#### The model estimates key performance metrics, including:

#### ✅ Average queue time for walk-in, drive-through, and soccer team customers
#### ✅ Total time spent in the system (order, wait, eat, and leave)
#### ✅ Number of drive-through customers who leave without ordering
#### ✅ Revenue loss from lost drive-through customers
#### ✅ Cashier and cook utilization rates
#### ✅ Time school bus leaves the system

## 📊 Results & Insights
#### 📌 Identifies bottlenecks in cashier & meal preparation process
#### 📌 Optimizes staffing during peak & non-peak hours
#### 📌 Improves drive-through efficiency to reduce lost sales
#### 📌 Enhances customer service experience & wait time management
