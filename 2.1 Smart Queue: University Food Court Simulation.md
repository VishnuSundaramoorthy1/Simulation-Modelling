# University Food Court Simulation - Arena Model
   #### This repository contains an Arena Simulation Model for optimizing a university food court’s operations. 
   #### The goal is to analyze customer flow, queueing behavior, and service performance to improve efficiency and reduce wait times.
   
### Problem Overview

#### Customers enter the food court from two entrances (A & B) and make food choices based on probabilistic behavior. The simulation captures:
#### ✔️ Customer Arrivals (exponentially distributed interarrival times)
#### ✔️ Decision-Making Process (slow, medium, fast thinkers)
#### ✔️ Queueing Behavior (FCFS discipline at food stations & cashiers)
#### ✔️ Walking Speeds & Travel Distances
#### ✔️ Service Times (randomized based on distribution)

### Simulation Objectives
#### The model estimates key performance metrics, including:
#### ✅ Average customer count in the food court
#### ✅ Time spent in the system (by entry point & food choice)
#### ✅ Queue sizes & waiting times at food stations & cashiers
#### ✅ Utilization rates of food servers & cashiers
#### ✅ Customer distribution by thinking style & entry point

### Results & Insights
#### 📌 Identifies bottlenecks in food stations & cashier queues
#### 📌 Optimizes staffing & layout for improved efficiency
#### 📌 Provides data-driven insights for decision-making
